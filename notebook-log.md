## Dataset for class final project
Dataset from Multilocus phylogeny and Bayesian estimates of species boundaries reveal hidden evolutionary relationships and cryptic diversity in Southeast Asian monitor lizards (Welton et al., 2013)

Dataset: Using a 5-gene dataset, we estimated phylogeny and used multilocus genetic networks, analysis of population structure, and a Bayesian coalescent approach to infer species boundaries. Our results contradict previous systematic hypotheses, reveal surprising relationships between island and mainland lineages, and uncover novel, cryptic evolutionary lineages (i.e. new putative species).

## All Software Used 
| Software | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses | Assumptions | User Choices |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Muscle | Program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. Includes fast distance estimation using k mer counting, progressive alignment, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. | Fast and accurate for large datasets | MUSCLE's accuracy drops when aligning highly divergent sequences | MUSCLE assumes using k-mer counting (a fast distance measurement) and then iterative refinment can produce results similiar to computationally expensive methods but faster | User choices TBD |
